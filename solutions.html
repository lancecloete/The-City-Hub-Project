    <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
    <p>The The City Hub could implement a centralized online platform designed specifically for small business owners like Ahmed Hassan. This platform would provide the following:</p>

    <h3>Functions & Features</h3>
    <h3>Centralized Supplier Directory</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A comprehensive list of local producers and suppliers with detailed profiles, including product types, quality certifications, and contact information.</li>
      <li>Search and filter options by product type, quality, price range, and supplier ratings.</li>
      <li>Supplier reviews and ratings from other businesses, helping Ahmed make informed decisions about who to buy from.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Online Wholesale Ordering System</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A user-friendly interface for placing bulk orders directly from suppliers, with options to customize quantities and delivery preferences.</li>
      <li>Real-time inventory updates to ensure product availability and reduce the chances of out-of-stock situations.</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Quality Assurance and Certification Management</h3>

      <li>A system for suppliers to upload quality certifications, such as organic or fair trade labels, and for Ahmed to view and verify these certifications before purchasing.</li>
      <li>An automated quality control feature that flags any discrepancies or potential issues based on customer feedback and product inspection reports.</li>
      <li>A guarantee or return policy for products that do not meet quality standards, ensuring Ahmed receives high-quality goods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bulk Discount and Negotiation Tools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic pricing options that automatically apply discounts based on the volume of the order, incentivizing bulk purchases.</li>
      <li>A negotiation tool that allows Ahmed to directly communicate with suppliers to negotiate prices for large or recurring orders.</li>
      <li>Special promotions and seasonal discounts from suppliers, promoting engagement with local vendors and community support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Community Engagement and Relationship Building</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A forum or messaging system for businesses to connect with suppliers, share feedback, and discuss opportunities for collaboration.</li>
      <li>Events and virtual meet-ups organized by the platform to foster relationships between local businesses and vendors.</li>
      <li>A loyalty program that rewards businesses for consistently purchasing from local suppliers, encouraging long-term partnerships and community support.</li>
    </ul>
